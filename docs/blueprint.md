# **App Name**: Book Haven

## Core Features:

- Book Search: Allow users to search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
- Book Download: Enable users to download books in various formats (e.g., PDF, EPUB).
- Theme Switching: Allow users to switch between light and dark themes for optimal reading experience.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm tan (#D2B48C) to evoke a sense of classic literature and comfort. This choice avoids the cliché of blues and greens often used for 'knowledge' apps.
- Background color: Off-white (#F5F5DC) to provide a gentle contrast and reduce eye strain, especially in light mode; very dark gray (#1A1A1A) for dark mode.
- Accent color: Soft brown (#A67B5B), for interactive elements and highlights, providing contrast and a subtle visual interest.
- Body font: 'Literata', a transitional serif that will lend a literary and vintage feel to the body of the website.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a humanist sans-serif well suited to fashion, art, and design. When used as a header along with a 'Literata' body, it can make a web application pop.
- Use simple, line-based icons for navigation and actions. Ensure they are consistent with the overall style.
- Clean and spacious layout with a focus on readability. Use clear visual hierarchy to guide the user through the content.
- Subtle transitions for theme switching and content loading. Avoid excessive animations that may distract the user.
